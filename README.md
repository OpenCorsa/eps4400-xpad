# Gamepad controller for EPS4400-pico

The main goals for this tool is:
* Providing easy to use (mainly for debugging & development of new features) way of controlling [eps4400-pico](https://github.com/OpenCorsa/eps4400-pico) board,
* Alternative way of controlling car's steering wheel (i.e. for people with disabilities),
* Remote steering mechanism (depending on your controller's range, would require also implementing remote accelration & braking systems).

Project objectives:
* [ ] [Controller support](#supported--tested-controllers)
* [ ] [Steering using torque](#torque-steering)
* [ ] [Steering using angle](#angle-steering)
* [ ] [Safety features](#safety)
