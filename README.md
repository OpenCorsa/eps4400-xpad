# Gamepad controller for EPS4400-pico

The main goals for this tool is to provide:
* Easy to use (mainly for debugging & development of new features) controller for [eps4400-pico](https://github.com/OpenCorsa/eps4400-pico) board
* Alternative way of controlling car's steering wheel (i.e. for people with disabilities)
* Car remote steering mechanism (depending on your controller's range)

Project requirements:
* Linux machine (i.e. Raspberry Pi)
* CanBus interface for connecting to [eps4400-pico](https://github.com/OpenCorsa/eps4400-pico)
* USB / Bluetooth connection for pad

Project objectives:
* [ ] [Controller support](#supported--tested-controllers)
* [ ] [Steering using torque](#torque-steering)
* [ ] [Steering using angle](#angle-steering)
* [ ] [Safety features](#safety)
